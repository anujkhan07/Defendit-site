## 🚨 Problem Statement

The private security industry in India faces several critical challenges:

- Unverified and untrained security manpower  
- Manual and agent-based booking systems  
- No real-time availability or pricing transparency  
- Poor user experience and lack of accountability  
- Limited access to short-notice or on-demand security  

These gaps make professional security unreliable and inaccessible when it is needed most.

- Instant booking of security professionals  
- Verified guards with identity and background checks
